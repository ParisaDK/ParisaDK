# Web Tracker in Go


## Introduction
The main purpose of this repository is to practice different aspects of the Go programming language. As a starting point, doing baby stuff 👶🍼, I am designing a website tracker🔍 that can be integrated into any website. 

## Web Tracker Project
The web tracker is a tool I am developing to understand visitor interactions with web pages. I would like to make it easily deployable on various websites and aims to collect data in a respectful manner.
