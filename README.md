# Web Tracker in Go


##Introduction
The main purpose of this repository is to practice different aspects of the Go programming language. As a starting point, I am designing a website tracker that can be integrated into any website. This project serves as a real-world application of Go, providing me with hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development.

## Web Tracker Project
The web tracker is a tool I am developing to understand visitor interactions with web pages. It is designed to be easily deployable on various websites and aims to collect data in a respectful and privacy-conscious manner.
